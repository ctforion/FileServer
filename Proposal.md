# Get user profile
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost/FileServer/api/users.php?action=profile
```

### File Operations
```bash
# Upload File with metadata
curl -X POST -F "file=@document.pdf" -F "description=Important document" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost/FileServer/api/upload.php
