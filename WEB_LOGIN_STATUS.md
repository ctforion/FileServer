   - ✅ Input validation
   - ✅ Session management
   - ✅ XSS protection

3. **User Management**
   - ✅ Admin user: `admin` / `admin123`
   - ✅ Test admin user: `testadmin` / `mypassword123`

   - ✅ Last login and IP tracking

4. **Web Interface**
   - ✅ Responsive login form
   - ✅ Error message display
   - ✅ Proper form validation
   - ✅ Automatic redirects after login

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Start Development Server
```bash
# In the FileServer directory
php -S localhost:8080
```

Then open your browser and go to:
- **Login Page**: http://localhost:8080/web/login.php
- **Main App**: http://localhost:8080/index.php (after login)

### Option 2: Use with Apache/Nginx
Place the FileServer folder in your web server document root and access:
- **Login Page**: http://your-domain/FileServer/web/login.php

## 👤 Login Credentials

**Primary Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Secondary Admin Account:**
- Username: `testadmin`
- Password: `mypassword123`

## 🔧 System Features

### Login Flow
1. User visits `web/login.php`
2. Form is displayed with CSRF protection
3. User enters credentials
4. System validates CSRF token
5. System checks rate limiting
6. System validates input
7. System authenticates user (checks both plain text and hashed passwords)
8. System updates login statistics
9. System creates session
10. System redirects to `index.php`

### Error Handling
- Invalid credentials show error message
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- CSRF token validation prevents cross-site attacks
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

### Session Management
- Secure session creation
- Session validation on protected pages
- Automatic logout for inactive sessions
- Session destruction on logout

## 🛠 Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `web/login.php` - Main login form and processing
- `core/database/DatabaseManager.php` - Updated for plain text password support
- `core/auth/UserManager.php` - Enhanced authentication methods
- `core/utils/SecurityManager.php` - CSRF and security features
- `data/users.json` - User data with plain text passwords

### Database Structure
Users are stored in `data/users.json` with both plain text passwords (new) and hashed passwords (legacy) for backward compatibility.

## 🎯 Testing Results

All tests have been completed successfully:
- ✅ Core authentication working
- ✅ Web form structure correct
- ✅ POST processing functional
- ✅ Session management active
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Security features enabled
- ✅ Redirects configured

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current Configuration:**
- Plain text passwords for easy administration (as requested)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting active
- Input validation in place
- Session security implemented

**For Production Use:**
Consider enabling password hashing by modifying the `DatabaseManager::createUser()` method to use `password_hash()` instead of storing plain text passwords.

## 📝 Conclusion

The web login system is **100% functional** and ready for use. The previous issues have been resolved:

1. ❌ ~~"Undefined array key 'log_path'"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
2. ❌ ~~"Class 'EnvLoader' not found"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
3. ❌ ~~"Undefined variable $clientIp"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
4. ❌ ~~"Session conflicts"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
5. ❌ ~~"CSRF token validation issues"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**
6. ❌ ~~"Form not connecting to authentication"~~ → ✅ **FIXED**

The login form now properly connects to the authentication system and processes login requests correctly. Users can successfully log in and will be redirected to the main application.

**Status: COMPLETE AND WORKING** ✅
